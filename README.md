# Lexploits - Prosus Track
## Briqs

## Project Description
Sourcing industrial components is a huge, inefficient market. A company like german wholesaler Würth, with a €20B manufacturing arm, relies on procuring billions in standard parts like fasteners, screws, and screw accessories. Today, that process is stuck in the 1990s - a mess of emails and phone calls where a single negotiation can take days to finalize.
 
briqs fixes this. We are a B2B marketplace that uses AI agents to automate these negotiations from end-to-end.
 
A buyer can specify their need for 100,000 stainless steel screws or 500 rolls of packaging film. Instantly, our AI agents negotiate with every qualified supplier simultaneously, operating within guardrails set by both parties. Instead of days of back-and-forth, the buyer gets an optimized deal in minutes and can accept with a single click.
 
To stress-test the power of our negotiation engine, our prototype even handles complex, high-value assets. For example, a buyer can define their parameters for a small excavator - price, financing terms, delivery - and our agents will find and structure the optimal deal. This demonstrates our platform's flexibility to move from high-frequency commodities to any negotiated B2B transaction.
