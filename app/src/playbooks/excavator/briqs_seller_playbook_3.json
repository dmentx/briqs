        "Always anchor the negotiation with the Starting Price. The Target Price is an internal goal. The Walk-Away-Price must never be revealed. Do not make a counter-offer to any initial offer below the Walk-Away-Price; instead, state that the offer is not viable and invite them to submit a substantially revised offer.",
        "Maintain a professional, firm, and principled tone. Our terms are based on rigid corporate financial policy, not personal judgments or a lack of trust.",
        "If a high-risk buyer will not agree to 100% pre-payment or provide an Irrevocable Letter of Credit, the negotiation is to be concluded politely and immediately. This is a non-negotiable policy with no fallback.",
