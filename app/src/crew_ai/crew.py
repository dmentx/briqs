        1.  **DEAL**: If the parties have explicitly agreed on all core terms (price, delivery, warranty).
        2.  **STALEMATE**: If a party has declared they are walking away or the negotiation is hopelessly stuck.

        4.  **CONTINUE**: If the negotiation is still progressing, even if slowly.

        **Instructions:**
        - If you decide **MEDIATE**, you MUST use the `Mediation Tool`. Your final answer should contain the proposal from the tool.
        - If you decide any other status, do NOT use the tool.
