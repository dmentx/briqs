# Project Scratchpad - Multi-Agent Negotiation System ☕

## Initial Planning Session (over morning coffee)

### Project Vision
Building a sophisticated four-agent negotiation system where:
- **Buyer Agent**: Represents purchasing interests, follows contract playbooks
- **Seller Agent**: Represents selling interests, follows contract playbooks  
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Process manager, controls negotiation flow and agent coordination
- **Mediator Agent**: Conflict resolver, evaluates deal feasibility when consensus fails

### Key Architectural Insights
- **CrewAI Framework**: Perfect for multi-agent coordination
- **Contract Playbooks**: Strategic knowledge bases for each negotiating party
- **Mediation Process**: Structured negotiation flow with neutral evaluation
- **Deal Evaluation**: Clear success/failure criteria and reasoning

### Questions to Explore ☕
1. What types of contracts are we negotiating? (B2B services, product sales, partnerships?)
2. How complex should the playbooks be? (Simple rules vs. sophisticated strategies)
3. What constitutes a "successful deal" vs. "failed negotiation"?
4. Should the mediator have access to both playbooks or remain truly neutral?
5. What negotiation parameters should be configurable? (price ranges, terms, deadlines)

### Technical Architecture Ideas
- **Frontend**: CrewAI CLI interface for demo/testing
- **Backend**: Python with CrewAI orchestration
- **Knowledge Base**: YAML-based contract playbooks
- **Memory System**: Track negotiation history and patterns
- **LLM Integration**: Different models for different agent personalities

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Core agent architecture with basic playbooks
2. **Phase 2**: Sophisticated negotiation logic and mediator evaluation
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (memory, learning, complex scenarios)

## Current Task Reference
- **Active Task**: [Multi-Agent Negotiation System](implementation-plan/multi-agent-negotiation-system.md) ✅ **PLANNING COMPLETE**

## Planning Deliverables Created ☕
- **Project Scratchpad**: Initial brainstorming and architectural insights
- **Implementation Plan**: 12-phase development roadmap with detailed task breakdown
- **Product Requirements Document**: Comprehensive PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Specification**: Deep-dive into system architecture and implementation details
- **API Contracts**: Complete API documentation and interface specifications

## Lessons Learned
- [2024-12-25] Always start with clear agent role definitions in CrewAI
- [2024-12-25] Use CrewAI's built-in memory system for negotiation history
- [2024-12-25] Contract playbooks should be separate knowledge bases per agent
- [2024-12-25] MCP Context7 is excellent for gathering comprehensive framework documentation
- [2024-12-25] Multi-agent systems require careful orchestration and process design
- [2024-12-25] **MAJOR INSIGHT**: Separate process management from conflict resolution - orchestrator controls flow, mediator resolves deadlocks
- [2024-12-25] Four-agent architecture provides better separation of concerns than three-agent design
